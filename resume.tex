                \item Automation of operational tasks using Ruby and Bash. Examples include automatic rollout of new configuration variables to running services and nightly zero downtime application of operating system updates to instances in ECS clusters.
                \item Assist with new service rollouts by helping developer teams estimate capacity needs, build cloud infrastructure with Terraform, and write playbooks to minimize MTTR of future incidents after service rollout.
                \item Administration of large-scale containerized Ruby on Rails application and backing services in AWS ECS..
                \item Document operational tasks to enable repeatable actions and future automation.

                \item Migrated cloud infrastructure from Heroku to a cluster of Docker containers in AWS ECS. Work included writing Dockerfiles to move to a container runtime environment, building cloud infrastructure with Terraform, enabling blue/green deployments with CircleCI and Bash, and ensuring a zero downtime switch of production traffic from Heroku to AWS.
                \item Participant in after-hours and daytime PagerDuty rotation. Respond to platform emergencies and alerts and debug production issues across all levels of the stack.
                \item Teaching and documenting on-call processes to establish strong operational readiness across teams. Lead postmortems and root cause analysis to improve all aspects of system performance and reliability in order to increase MTBF and minimize MTTR.
                \item Set up operational dashboards using New Relic and Prometheus with alerts flowing to Slack and PagerDuty for visualizing service metrics and performance of production environments.
                \item Documented Terraform IAC best practices to enable education and adoption throughout the organization.
